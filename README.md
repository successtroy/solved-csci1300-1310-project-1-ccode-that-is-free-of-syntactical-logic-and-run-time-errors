Objectives:1. P​roduce code that is free of syntactical, logic, and run-time errors. 2. Design and create code in C++ using objects and classes, information encapsulation, and efficient class design.Submitting Your Code to Moodle

For this assignment, you will need to submit your main.cpp and your class files (.hpp and .cpp) and the pseudo code which you completed as a part of Assignment 7 in a zip file. Please name this file ​Lastname_Firstname_Project1.zip ​ .You must submit your code to Moodle to get full credit for the assignment. Please also include comments in your code to describe what your code is doing. Comments should also include your name, recitation TA, and the assignment. TAs will be checking that your code has comments.

Your TA will be hand-grading your code, examining your project to make sure that you meet the requirements of the assignment and assessing how well you coded your solution. You can expect interview gradings too.

What to do if you have questions

There are several ways to get help on assignments in CSCI 1310, and depending on your question, some sources are better than others. If, after reading this write up, you need clarification on what you’re being asked to do in the assignment, the TAs and the course instructor are better sources of information.

Minimum Requirements

Your project must compile. Otherwise, you loose all the 40 points for the technical part (see grading rubric at the end). If your project does not compile or you are not satisfied with your work, you might choose to attend an interview to explain how hard you’ve worked, although asking for the standard extension may be more beneficial.

Your project must have the following features:

● When your code first runs, it should display a welcome message and a detailed description of what your code does. ● You need to provide an interactive menu that allows whomever is running your code tochoose what functionality they would like to try out. This menu should be explicit and detail exactly what will happen when an option is selected. ● 2 loops (either while or for, or one of each) ● 4 if/else if/else blocks ● 4 numerical variables ● 4 strings ● File I/O and Console I/O ○ Writing to a file. ○ Reading from a file or ask the user for input and handle that input. ● 4 classes, including ○ At least one base and one derived class ○ At least one nested class ○ At least one of the classes needs to contain multiple constructors, and each of those constructors needs to be used in your program. ○ The derived class should have at least one overloaded member function from the base class. ○ At least 16 member functions total in all classes. For example, each of the four classes could contain 4 functions, including the constructor. ○ At least one Friend function and an overloaded operator.

Project Contest:

To incentivize against going out to the Internet and downloading a pre-built Sudoku game, we will be having a contest for who submits the best project. (We’ll also be interview grading everyone, so you better be able to explain that Sudoku game.) In the interest of fairness, each student’s work will be analysed based on the efforts and the difficulty of the project. They will be categorized as below: ● Novice Project. ● Intermediate Project. ● Advanced Project. Based on the students creativity, prior programming experience and efforts, 2 students will be nominated for each category.

FAQs: 1. Do I have to design my own project, or can I work with a friend to design a game? Everyone needs to submit individual work for their game. You are welcome to ask for help with coding issues or to get input on your idea, but each of you needs to submit individual work. 2. Who will be judging the contest? The TA will nominate projects, and then the TA and I will discuss all of the nominated projects and select the winners. 3. What do I get if I win? 2 points added to your final grade. For example, if I calculate your grade and it is an 89, and then I see that you won the programming contest, then your final grade will be a 91. 4. If I do the absolute minimum, can I still get a good grade? Yes. Any project that fulfills the requirements listed above, works, and is explained well, will receive an A. 5. What percentage of my course grade is this project? 5%
